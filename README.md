# Datenstrom community

Ask questions, report bugs and work with us. [Read the guidelines](https://datenstrom.se/yellow/help/contributing-guidelines).

## How to ask questions

Write the question in the title, it's the first thing everyone will see. Our community is a place to help each other. Where you can ask and answer questions. Most answers are provided by members, just like you. Use an online translator if English is not your first language.

## How to report bugs

Explain how to reproduce the bug, with as many information as you have. Check your log file, it gives a quick overview of what happens on your website. Activate the debug mode to investigate the cause of a problem. Select an answer, when the bug has been fixed.
