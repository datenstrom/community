## How to ask questions

Write the question in the title, it's the first thing everyone will see. The Datenstrom community is a place to help each other. Where you can ask and answer questions. Most answers are provided by members, just like you. Use a translator if English is not your first language.

## How to report bugs

Explain how to reproduce the bug, with as many information as you have. Activate the debug mode to investigate the cause of a problem. Add the log file to the bug report, it gives an overview of what happens on your website. Select an answer, when the bug has been fixed.
