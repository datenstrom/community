## How to ask a question

Write the question in the title, it's the first thing everyone will see. The Datenstrom community is a place to help each other. Where you can ask and answer questions. Most answers are provided by members, just like you. Use a translator if English is not your first language. Describe the problem you are trying to solve. Explain what you have tried so far. Select an answer, when your question has been answered. [Start a new discussion](https://github.com/datenstrom/community/discussions/categories/ask-a-question).

## How to report a bug

Explain how to reproduce the bug and provide detailed information. Activate the debug mode to investigate the cause of a problem. Add the log file of your website. Check if the bug occurs in a brand new installation. Select an answer, when the bug has been fixed.

## How to work with us

We focus on people. Not on technical details and lots of features. There are many ways to become active in the Datenstrom community. Imagine what the user wants to do and what would make their life easier. Then look at files, folders and the API for developers.
