## How to ask questions

Write the question in the title, it's the first thing everyone will see. The Datenstrom community is a place to help each other. Where you can ask and answer questions. Most answers are provided by members, just like you. Use a translator if English is not your first language. Describe the problem you are trying to solve. Explain what you have tried so far. Select an answer, when your question has been answered. [Start a new discussion](https://github.com/datenstrom/community/discussions/categories/ask-a-question).

## How to report bugs

Explain how to reproduce the bug, with as many information as you have. Activate the debug mode to investigate the cause of a problem. Add the log file to show what happens on your website. Select an answer, when the bug has been fixed. [Start a new discussion](https://github.com/datenstrom/community/discussions/categories/report-a-bug).
